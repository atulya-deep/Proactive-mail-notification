## OUR SOLUTIONS
**`Function Separation:`** Each function is separated into different Python files, ensuring modularity and maintainability. This allows for easier management and future enhancements to specific functionalities.

**`Selenium for GUI Interaction:`** The Selenium Python library is utilized for interacting with the LinkedIn GUI. It enables automated login and retrieval of unread messages and notifications from the user's LinkedIn profile.

**`Data Storage in CSV:`** The fetched data, including unread messages and notifications, is stored in a CSV file. The data is accompanied by a timestamp, providing a historical record of the user's LinkedIn activity.

**`Scheduler and SMTP for Periodic Notifications:`** To enable periodic notifications to the user, a scheduler is implemented. The scheduler triggers the notification process at regular intervals. The SMTP library is used for email delivery, ensuring that the user receives the notification in their Gmail account.

**`Password Protection:`** To safeguard passwords, the easy gui library is used for secure password input. The cryptography library provides encryption and decryption functionalities, ensuring password security during storage andÂ transmission.
